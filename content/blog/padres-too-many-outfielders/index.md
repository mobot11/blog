Is there any truth to the timeless American idiom "Too much of a good thing"? It depends. I'd be more than happy to have too much money, or too many friends. However when it comes to the Padres' outfield – we have a classic example of too much of a good thing.

Writing the words "Padres", "good" and "thing" in the same sentence felt as weird writing as I'm sure it did while reading, but for the first time in years the Padres have a categorically good team. It's been a long time coming for Friars fans — the last time the team made the playoffs was thirteen years ago. Only two teams: the Miami Marlins and my hometown Seattle Mariners have a longer stretch of missing the post season.

If I was a betting man, I'd pick the Padres to move off of this list sooner than both the Mariners and the Marlins. The Mariners, who won 89 games last year and still finished way out of the wildcard race, [are cursed](https://thecomeback.com/mlb/the-seattle-mariners-really-might-be-cursed.html). And the Marlins are in full rebuild mode, having just traded two former M.V.Ps in a salary dump after Derek Jeter & friends [drastically overpaid](https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/barry-jackson/article191481449.html) for the unpopular franchise. And whose old President of Baseball Operations [literally told fans to go f**k](https://twitter.com/LeBatard_Reddit/status/1074852245655748608) themselves after completing the deal.
Meanwhile the Padres are a team chock-full of young, exciting talent and are trending in the right direction. The front office signed superstar third baseman Manny Machado to a blockbuster contract this spring. They also bucked conventional MLB front office wisdom by actually trying to put the best players in the organization on the team, regardless of service time considerations. As most baseball fans already know, 21 year old wunderkind Fernando Tatis Jr. was a surprise addition to the 25 man roster despite never having played above AA. But there was less fan-fare around the addition of lefty starting pitcher Nick Margevicius, the Padres #39 prospect who has only one year of high A ball under his belt.

Wether the latter says more about the questionable state of the team's starting pitching or the front office and their willingness to be aggressive with inexperienced prospects remains to be seen, but either way the Padres farm system was [ranked #1 for the second consecutive year](https://www.mlb.com/news/top-10-farm-systems-in-mlb?t=mlb-pipeline-coverage). It's probably safe to assume the major league team will have no shortage of talent flowing in from the minor league system from years to come.

This leads me to my next question, can too much young talent be a bad thing? In the case of the Padres' outfield I'd argue yes. It's easy to disregard this statement when taken at face value. 29 other MLB franchises are scratching and clawing to collect as much young, cheap, team controlled talent as possible. The Red Sox just won a world series with both corner outfield spots filled by players making less than one million dollars a year. These types of players are easily the most valuable in all of baseball. But I'd argue there are some subtle differences that make the Padres current situation less than ideal.

First off, the Padres have five outfielders under the age of 30 that are good enough to start on most other major league teams. At 28, Wil Meyers is the senior member of the group, and also the one who will receive the most consistent playing time. That leaves Hunter Renfroe, Franmil Reyes, Franchy Cordero and Manuel Margot to split time between the two spots not occupied by Meyers. Margot is
