I will be the first to admit that my GitHub is a graveyard of aborted or unfinished projects.

Every so often, in the shower or on my ride to work, I think of a really cool project that would make an awesome web app. I envision it in my head, I can almost see how it will look on the screen when I'm finished. I start making plans. I get home from work and draw up an outline of how it will work and some basic functionality and then start coding.

The first few days are a thrill. I crank out code and build the skeleton of what will be my Cool New Web Application. I start adding the basic features and styling it to look presentable, I can finally see the building blocks of what I envisioned in my head on my laptop screen. Things are going well.

Unfortunately, keeping up this momentum is almost impossible. I have a full time job, I enjoy spending time outdoors or at the gym. I have social and family commitments. All of the sudden, as my Cool New Web Application starts to get more and more complicated, I start to lose interest.

Eventually I have a semi-functioning application that does half of the things I imagined. I am disappointed that it isn't as perfect as I envisioned it. I start spending less and less time on it and more time thinking of other cool, new web applications I can build. Then one day I get a perfect idea for a new Cool New Web Application and the process starts over again – rinse, wash, repeat.

This creates the GitHub graveyard I described, and I know I'm not the only one. As developers, we try to make everything perfect. We want to release the best product and give end users the most complete experience possible. However we are usually working with an entire team of intelligent dedicated individuals to make this happen. When working alone, for free — wanting to release something perfect can often get in the way of releasing anything at all. We might be afraid of ridicule for showing off something that's incomplete. Maybe others will think our Cool New Web Application is really a Dumb Stupid P.O.S.

Luckily, this is often never the case. In my opinion there is almost no negative consequences to shipping a personal project early, and the benefits are numerous. If your idea is sound, even showing something incomplete will get people thinking "hey this Cool New Web Application is a pretty cool idea". Additionally the feeling of having something to show and getting a second set of eyes on it can reignite the fire that you had when you first started building the project.

So what have I learned about personal projects? In the words of Steve Jobs "real artists ship". Having something incomplete is better than having nothing at all. Ship early, ship often. Don't worry about your thing not being perfect or being incomplete. Put your art out there and let others help you craft it into what you originally imagined. Be a real artist, ship.
